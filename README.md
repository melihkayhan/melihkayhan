Hi!
I am a graduate automotive engineering student based in Germany and I am currently working on automation of processes in the field of automotive.
In detail, I am working with the Qt framework for Python to create solutions to make daily life easier.
In my free time I work on projects related to AI.

Feel free to ask me questions regarding my work.
